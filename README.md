# Project-Mayhem

<bold> Description. “Our application helps people target what news they are interested in while being able to avoid undesriable content.”

Motivation. “Our initial motivation was to avoid spoilers to sports events and favorite tv shows and stil be able to use the internet to get information.”

Result. “Using Google News API and Google NLP Cloud we were able to build an API that allows the user to search the News API and filter out undesired topics. We then used the Google NLP Cloud API to analyze the text of the article as classify it as positve, neutral, or negative."

Team Efforts. “Jeff singlehandedly created the UI and helped figure out how to use a callback to . Chelsey worked on the Google News API call and getting the front end and back end working together. Nate worked on the Google NLP API call and the read time feature.”

Individual Responsibilities. “In particular, I...” Used Promises to write a helper library for API calls that Andrew could use on thefront-end;Etc.

Challenges. “Eventually, we realized that the fact that JavaScript is asynchronousmeant our UI wouldn’t work with the code we’d written to call the external APIs. So. Iused Promises to wrap our API calls and simplify our refactor of the front-end.

Improvements. “In the future, we’d like to add a way to ‘crowdsource’ exerciseinstructions—in particular, if a user searches for an exercise for which there are noinstructions, we’d like to allow them to upload their own, which other users could see,later.”
